4. Find your GitHub email address in your Account Settings under the Emails menu option.
    * If it is private this will be someone@user.noreply.github.com.
    * If your email is verified, it will have a green Primary next to your email address and skip to step 5.
5. If your email it is not verified follow [THESE](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address) steps from Github, then return to these instructions when complete.
6. Open Terminal
7. In Terminal, run:
```
brew install gnupg
```
This and the following step may take a little while, e.g. 15 minutes. Go grab yourself a coffee.

7. In Terminal, run:
```
gpg --version
```
to validate your installation. Your validation should look like (or newer):

8. In Terminal, run the following to generate a GPG key pair:
```
gpg --full-generate-key
```
   * At the prompt, specify option 4, "RSA (sign only), and press Enter.
   * At the prompt, specify 4096 as the key size, press Enter.
   * At the prompt, specify 1y as the the length of time the key should be valid, press Enter.
   * At the prompt, press Enter to leave the comment blank.

9. Verify that your selections are correct.

10. Enter your user ID information, which should be your real name (ie FirstName LastName).

11. Enter your Hudl email address that is verified in Github.
12. Enter a new passphrase. Keep your secret key secret.
   * Keep both the key and your password in a secure location (e.g. a password manager like `LastPass`), and don't lose it.

13. Open Finder and navigate to {location} and check to see if you have a gpg.conf file
   * If the file does not exist, create it using a text editor and renaming the file with a .conf
 
14. Add the following two lines to your `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf` file.
```
no-tty
use-agent
```

15. Add the public GPG key to your [GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)
   * Note: Go through steps 11-14 in "generated your GPG key" (noted in step 4 of the guide above) to generate the actual key

16. Follow the steps in [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/telling-git-about-your-signing-key)

17. In Terminal, run `git config --global commit.gpgsign true` to instruct git to sign all of your commits automatically.

18. Run the following command to do some cleanup:
```
brew uninstall pinentry-mac
```

19. Now install the GPG Suite versions
```
brew install --cask gpg-suite
```

20. Once installed, open Spotlight and search for "GPGPreferences", or open system preferences and select "GPGPreferences"

21. Select the Default Key if it is not already selected, and ensure "Store in OS X Keychain" is checked:

GPG_TTY=$(tty)

```

   * And then exit out of the editor (^X) and save the document (Y)

   * And run this command:
```

```

23. Run:
```
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
```

3. Press <kbd>Return</kbd> when asked "Enter passphrase" and "Enter same passphrase again"
4. Run: `ls ~/.ssh` and confirm `id_ed25519.pub` is present

   * Navigate to SSH and GPG tab in Github
